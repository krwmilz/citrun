.Sh NAME
.Nm citrun-check
.Nd check directories for instrumentation artifacts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script recursively checks either
.Ar dir
or the current working directory for instrumentation artifacts.
.Pp
A summary is printed showing detailed counts of important events. The following
is an example of what the output looks like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Checking '/usr/ports/pobj/spidermonkey-24.2.0/'...
       3  Log files found
     185  Calls to the instrumentation tool
     117  Forked compilers
      97  Instrumentation successes
      19  Instrumentation failures (false positive)
       1  Instrumentation failures (true positive)
      60  Application link commands
.Ed
.Pp
The value of
.Qq Instrumentation failures (true positive)
is important. If
this value is more than 0 it means that instrumentation failed but a native
compile of the same source succeeded.
