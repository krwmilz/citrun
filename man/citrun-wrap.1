.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
clang or clang++
.It
egcc or eg++
.It
gcc or g++
.It
cc or c++

.Pp
All instrumentation activity is logged to
.Pa citrun.log .
Instrumentation summaries can be generated by the
.Xr citrun-check 1
script.
.Pp
Incremental building is supported. If the build command fails, fix the problem
and then rerun the build command with
.Nm .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa citrun.log
Instrumentation log.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with the build command exit code.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Let
.Qq program
exist. It is:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
written in C
.It
compiled with gcc
.It
built with make and make searches PATH for gcc
.El
.Pp
Prepending
